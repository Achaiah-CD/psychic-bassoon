### A text based blackjack game 

One player and one dealer play out a set of blackjack games.  

> **Each number card has its number as value.  
> Ace can be either 11 or 1.  
> All face cards have value 10.**  

You bust when you hit 22 or more.  
Dealer must deal(hit) himself till his card value is atleast 17 after which he can stop(stand).  
Dealer busts when he too reaches 22 or more.  

#### Disclaimer!!
The dealer's initial drawn card is hidden from the player, only the second deal is known.

### To update
- Keep count of games won and lost.  
- Keep track of highest streak.  
* Maybe add the feature of betting money.  
* Cleaner code by adding wrappers and decorators.
